<p>Now that weâ€™ve identified some interesting services running on our target machine, letâ€™s do a little bit of research into one of the weirder services identified: Icecast. Icecast, or well at least this version running on our target, is heavily flawed and has a high level vulnerability with a score of 7.5.
