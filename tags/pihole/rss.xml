Pi-hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole and optionally a DHCP server, intended for use on a private network.It works by intercepting DNS requests made by devices on your network and blocking requests to domains you provide on the adlist such as (.eg.,advertisements/tracking/phishing domains.)
What is unbound? Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. It is designed to resolve domain names by starting from the root DNS servers and recursively traversing the DNS hierarchy until it obtains the final IP address associated with a domain.</description></item></channel></rss>
