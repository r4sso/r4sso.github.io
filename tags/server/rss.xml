I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what this board is called, it was taken from all-in-one PC from an old ticketing machine a few years ago. Even though it ain&amp;rsquo;t that powerful, it&amp;rsquo;s served me well for years.
Hardware CPU: Intel Celeron J1800 (2) @ 2.58 GHz RAM: 4GB DDR3L 1333Mhz Storage: 32GB mSATA Software I tried a couple of different operating systems, but Alpine Linux is the most suitable for my use and this machine.</description></item></channel></rss>
