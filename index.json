[{"categories":"","content":"This article was meant to be published last year, but here we go. I will update this post as time goes by, sharing more things I learn and discover.\nIn early of 2023, I discovered Hugo, a Static Site Generator. Additionally, I learned about Tailwindcss. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of experience when it comes to developing websites. I have made websites with plain HTML, CSS, and even Bootstrap, but they were mostly for fun projects that I didn\u0026rsquo;t finish and eventually abandoned. This website is probably the only one I took seriously and actually completed.\nBelow are a few things I learned when creating this site.\nOptimization Reducing the overall size and bandwidth usage is crucial for performance. If you look the web today, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that it\u0026rsquo;s often bloated with unnecessary analytics, and ads.\nHugo Hugo provides a convenient way to minify CSS, JS, JSON, HTML, SVG, or XML resources using resources.Minify. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example in Go HTML template:\n{{ $css := resources.Get \u0026#34;css/main.css\u0026#34; }} {{ $style := $css | resources.Minify }} Additionally, you can minify the final HTML output to /public by running the following command:\nhugo --minify Tailwind CSS Tailwind CSS is incredibly performance-focused and aims to produce the smallest CSS file possible by only generating the CSS you are actually using in your project. To minify Tailwind CSS, you can use the following command:\nnpx tailwindcss -o build.css --minify Images Images are the biggest oversight, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some site display uncompressed images (including me previously LOL) that can be several megabytes in size. As a result, this can significantly slow down and negatively impact its performance.\nSize Them Correctly Ensure that your images are appropriately sized. If the max-width of your website is 960px, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to serve images with a width larger than that. Similarly, if it\u0026rsquo;s a thumbnail, use a thumbnail-sized image.\nServe Them in Modern Formats The WebP image format is widely supported by modern browsers and can significantly reduce the file size of JPEG or PNG images without a noticeable loss in quality.\nAVIF offers even better compression but since it\u0026rsquo;s relatively new, it\u0026rsquo;s not supported by Hugo. For sake of simplicity i will use WebP.\nLazy Load Them Take advantage of the lazy loading feature in HTML, which loads images as the user scrolls down the page and they come into view. This can improve the loading speed of pages with numerous images.\nSet the Correct Width and Height Always specify the width and height attributes for images to prevent content from shifting when the image loads, ensuring a smoother user experience. Learn more.\nSet the altText. Add descriptive alt text to your images, not only for users who rely on screen readers but also to enhance your search engine ranking. Additionally, it serves as a fallback when the image fails to load. Writing a brief sentence describing the image is a small but worthwhile effort.\nHugo image proccessing To implement into hugo, create file /layouts/_default/render-image.html1:\n{{ $src := .Page.Resources.GetMatch (printf \u0026#34;%s\u0026#34; (.Destination | safeURL)) }} {{ if $src }} \u0026lt;figure\u0026gt; {{ $data := newScratch }} {{ if gt $src.Width 1100 }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;webp\u0026#34; ($src.Resize \u0026#34;960x webp q90\u0026#34;) }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;fallback\u0026#34; ($src.Resize \u0026#34;960x q90\u0026#34;) }} {{ else }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;webp\u0026#34; ($src.Resize (printf \u0026#34;%dx%d webp q90\u0026#34; $src.Width $src.Height)) }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;fallback\u0026#34; ($src.Resize (printf \u0026#34;%dx%d q90\u0026#34; $src.Width $src.Height)) }} {{ end }} {{ $webp := $data.Get \u0026#34;webp\u0026#34; }} {{ $fallback := $data.Get \u0026#34;fallback\u0026#34; }} \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ $src.RelPermalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;picture\u0026gt; \u0026lt;source srcset=\u0026#34;{{ $webp.RelPermalink }}\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;image/webp\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;{{ $fallback.RelPermalink }}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;{{ .Text }}\u0026#34; loading=\u0026#34;lazy\u0026#34; decoding=\u0026#34;async\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;{{ $src.Width }}\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;{{ $src.Height }}\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/picture\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; {{ with .Title }}\u0026lt;figcaption\u0026gt;- {{ . | markdownify }}\u0026lt;/figcaption\u0026gt;{{ end }} \u0026lt;/figure\u0026gt; {{end}} Make sure to keep your images in the same directory as the post for this to work.\nIf the image is wider than 960px, it will resize it to 960px. Otherwise, it will keep the image size the same and just convert it to WebP. (It will also optimize the fallback image for browsers that don’t support WebP.)'\nWrap the image in a link to the original, unoptimized version of the image. So you can see the original images.\nUse like normally in your markdown:\n![Red Fox](fox.jpg \u0026#34;Photo by Ray Hennessy on Unsplash.\u0026#34;) - Photo by Ray Hennessy on Unsplash. This image is only 48 KB, compared to the original 188 KB (1920 x 1277)\nFonts To further optimize your website, use WOFF and WOFF2 font formats to reduce file size. You can use site like fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator to generate webfont for you. If its say file is corrupted you can use site like glyphrstudio.com/online/ \u0026amp; And export it.\nImages optimization reference: ericmurphy.xyz/blog/images/.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","href":"https://r4sso.github.io/2024/02/site-dev-what-i-learned/","title":"Site dev: What I Learned"},{"categories":"","content":"Todo Optimize images (Convert to WebP) Reduce fonts file size Fix need to refresh to change comment theme (For the future)\nGallery - If i have a lot of photo to share :) Changelog (10-11-2023)\nAdd Guestbook Optimize Table Of Content (Remove unnecessary JS) (03-10-2023)\n[thumb] Add support for (.gif and external url) Minify javascript Active navbar Fix need to refresh to change comment theme.

Pi-hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole and optionally a DHCP server, intended for use on a private network.It works by intercepting DNS requests made by devices on your network and blocking requests to domains you provide on the adlist such as (.eg.,advertisements/tracking/phishing domains.)\nWhat is unbound? Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. It is designed to resolve domain names by starting from the root DNS servers and recursively traversing the DNS hierarchy until it obtains the final IP address associated with a domain.\nThere are many ways to deploy Pi-hole and Unbound on Alpine Linux, but the easiest way is to use Docker with Docker Compose. In this article, I\u0026rsquo;ll be using the official Pi-hole image. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in a bundled image that already includes Unbound, you can check out the repository at github.com/chriscrowe/docker-pihole-unbound\nEnable community repository Use editor of your choice \u0026amp; uncomment community repository in /etc/apk/repositories\n#/media/cdrom/apks https://ap.edge.kernel.org/alpine/v3.17/main https://ap.edge.kernel.org/alpine/v3.17/community Install docker + docker-compose apk update apk add docker docker-cli-compose Create docker-compose.yaml The configuration below uses macvlan network driver.
